		a. Earning Rewards Points. The rewards available to you through the Rewards Program are based on the rewards points you earn. You can earn points by referring friends, posting positive testimonials to social media, making qualifying purchases from participating Conscious Kitchen's locations, whether in-person at the store or ordering by phone, through the Conscious Kitchen's mobile application or the Conscious Kitchen's website. You will earn rewards points based on the total amount paid for your purchase at the rate of 1 point for each One Dollar ($1.00) you spend with Conscious Kitchen's. Conscious Kitchen's may change this points earning equation at any time in its sole discretion. Certain exclusions apply, and you cannot earn rewards points on purchases of gift cards, tax, gratuities, delivery fees, promotional discounts, purchases made by redeeming your rewards, or purchases made through third-party meal delivery services such as Uber Eats, DoorDash®, or Postmates®.  Points may not be earned for purchases made there (regardless of whether such purchases are made in-person, by phone, through the Conscious Kitchen's mobile application or the Conscious Kitchen's website), nor can Conscious Kitchen's Rewards (as defined below) be redeemed there.  Reward points will be tracked by scanning your mobile device (with the Conscious Kitchen's mobile application) at the store when you pay for your order, or by scanning your receipt with the mobile application (note that receipts must be scanned within seven days of issue to earn points, and you may only scan up to three receipts in any 24-hour period). Generally, rewards points will be added to your account within 24 hours.  If you have questions about your points, please contact rewards@consciouskitchen513.com .  You may also earn points by participating in promotional activities or other opportunities we may offer from time to time. For further details about promotional opportunities, please visit our Rewards page. Rewards points for participation in promotional activities will be awarded as described in the applicable promotional offer and will be subject to any additional terms set forth in the promotional offer. Some promotional activities may limit the amount of rewards points earned per promotional activity. Rewards points for eligible participation in promotional activities may take seven or more days to be added to your Rewards Program account.

b. Converting Points into Rewards. Every one-hundred (100) points earned will be automatically converted into one (1) $10 Reward (“Conscious Kitchen's Reward”). Point totals required to earn Conscious Kitchen's Rewards are subject to change in Conscious Kitchen's sole discretion.

c. Redeeming Conscious Kitchen's Rewards. Each Conscious Kitchen's Reward is redeemable up to $10 off the purchase of menu items or merchandise in our store locations. Conscious Kitchen's Rewards are valid for use at any participating Conscious Kitchen's location, online at and mobile order through the Conscious Kitchen's mobile application. When using a Conscious Kitchen's Reward to order an item online or through the Conscious Kitchen's mobile application, you may redeem the Conscious Kitchen's Reward by choosing to apply it to your purchase during the checkout process. You may not redeem a Conscious Kitchen's Reward in the same order transaction in which you earned the necessary points to receive that Conscious Kitchen's Reward, and there is generally a four-hour delay after the last points were earned to be able to redeem a Conscious Kitchen's Reward.  Points accumulated under the Rewards Program are promotional and have no cash value. Similarly, Conscious Kitchen's Rewards have no cash value and cannot be applied to previous purchases. Your points, Conscious Kitchen's Rewards and your Rewards Program account are personal to you and may not be sold, transferred (by operation of law or otherwise) or assigned to, or shared with, family, friends or others, or used by you for any commercial purpose. You are responsible for any taxes related to your participation in the Rewards Program.

			In addition to redeeming Conscious Kitchen's Rewards, participation in the Rewards Program also comes with other Rewards Program benefits. For example, from time to time, we may send special offers and coupons using the contact information provided at the time of enrollment. Special offers may include periodic discounts on menu items or packaged goods, or the opportunity to earn bonus Rewards Program points. Special offers may have certain restrictions including expiration dates and short, time-limited redemption periods. Special offers are personal to you and cannot be shared, copied or transferred. Read each offer carefully for specific details, expiration dates, limitations and restrictions.
We elect to provide you with a unique referral link (“Referral Link”) that identifies you as the referral source for prospective Rewards Program customer (“Prospective Customer“). You are permitted to distribute your Referral Links to Prospective Customers for the purpose of promoting the Rewards Program. Distribution of your Referral Link may be made by the “Share” button on the referral page (“Invite Friends”) in the Conscious Kitchen's mobile application. If a Prospective Customer uses your Referral Link to register for a new Rewards Program account and makes a purchase under his/her Rewards Program account, you will receive a referral bonus, as determined by us. Without notice to you, Conscious Kitchen’s reserves the right to invalidate Referral Links at any time (including if we suspect fraudulent or improper use).
We may also elect to provide you with links (“Social Media Links”) “Share” positive testimonials in the Conscious Kitchen's mobile application and on social media to receive points. You will receive a referral bonus, as determined by us. Without notice to you, Conscious Kitchen’s reserves the right to invalidate Post if they are not positive testimonials at any time (including if we suspect fraudulent or improper use).

			Without notice to you, Conscious Kitchen's reserves the right to suspend and/or terminate your Conscious Kitchen's account and/or your participation in the Rewards Program if Conscious Kitchen's determines in its sole discretion that you have violated these Terms, you have more than one (1) account, or that the use of your account or your participation in the Rewards Program is unauthorized, abusive, deceptive, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful. Conscious Kitchen's may, in its sole discretion, suspend, cancel or combine accounts that appear to be duplicative. In the event that your participation in the Rewards Program is terminated, your points will be void and you will not be able to use any Conscious Kitchen's Rewards, even if the expiration dates associated with such points and Conscious Kitchen's Rewards have not yet passed.
Without notice to you, Conscious Kitchen's also reserves the right to “unregister” and make ineligible for the Rewards Program an account that is inactive. An inactive account is defined as an account that has not earned points for one year. In the event that your Rewards Program account is unregistered or rendered inactive, then you will no longer be eligible for points, Conscious Kitchen's Rewards or other Rewards Program benefits. You may reactivate your account by logging into your account and making a purchase using your account.
